# SEI-Project-4
# FASTival

## Small description
In Film Festivals, scheduling is a lengthy process where huge wooden boards and hundreds of paper cards are used to plan screenings across the multiple contracted cinema screens. 

FASTival was created with the intention to optimise this process by making it fully digital, and hence much friendlier for the environment.

## Get Started
### Prerequisites
The website is mobile friendly and the user can access it through the browser. 

### Installation steps
### How to use it
The programming staff can create screening slots representing contracted venue hires in place, upload film information based on accepted titles, and schedule these across the available slots. If a slot must be moved, it can be done so easiley by double clicking it and editing the times and/or cinema. If a film is deleted, its scheduling slot is reset to a vacant slot. This can be repopulated once a different title is chosen.

Non-logged in staff can easily consult the scheduling updates at a glance by accessing the film list and screening schedule without needing to log in. However, only logged in staff can make changes to the database and the schedule.
